# SyntaxTutor: An interactive Tool for Learning Syntax Analysis

SyntaxTutor is an educational application designed to help compiler students understand LL(1) and SLR(1) parsing algorithms. Through a visual and interactive interface, it guides users step-by-step through the computation of FIRST, FOLLOW, CLOSURE, GOTO, predictive parsing tables, and LR automata, offering real-time pedagogical feedback.

Rather than acting as a mere calculator, SyntaxTutor functions as a learning companion. It explains the reasoning behind each step, highlights common mistakes, and encourages students to engage with the theory behind the algorithms.

## üì¶ Downloads
Precompiled builds of SyntaxTutor are available in the Releases tab:
- üêß Linux (X11): executable AppImage
- ü™ü Windows: ZIP archive with the .exe
- üçé macOS: .app bundles for both Apple Silicon (ARM) and Intel

> [!WARNING]
> The Windows and macOS versions are not digitally signed. Your operating system may display a warning when running the application. You can bypass it manually if you trust the source.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source
To build SyntaxTutor from source, you just need:
- Qt6 (including `qmake6`)
- A C++20-compliant compiler
```
qmake6
make
````
This will generate the executable in te project directory.
